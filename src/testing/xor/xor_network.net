# N0 = A (AND detector)
# N1 = O1 (XOR true output)
# N2 = O0 (XOR false output)

# Sensory neurons (default threshold, will be stimulated externally)

# Interneurons with specific thresholds
NEURON N0 90.0 0.0 0.0  # A (AND) - use leak=0 for clean coincidence detection
NEURON N1 50.0 1.0 0.0  # O1 (XOR true)

# Connections (weights from XOR spec)
# S0, S1 -> O1 (N1)

# A -> O0 (excitatory)

# Default output when network is quiet (XOR false = N2)
