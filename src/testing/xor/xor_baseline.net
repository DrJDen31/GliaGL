# XOR Baseline (Dysfunctional)
# Purpose: A simple, incorrect network to sanity-check evaluation.
# This baseline maps both inputs equally to both outputs, with no AND/inhibition.
# Expected behavior:
# - 00 → both outputs silent (detector default decides, e.g., O0 if configured)
# - 01/10 → both outputs excited similarly (argmax unstable/ambiguous)
# - 11 → both outputs excited (no suppression), not XOR behavior

# Format
# NEURON <id> <threshold> <leak> <resting>
# CONNECTION <from_id> <to_id> <weight>

# Sensory
NEURON S0 100.0 1.0 0.0
NEURON S1 100.0 1.0 0.0

# Outputs only (no A/AND)
NEURON O1 50.0 1.0 0.0
NEURON O0 50.0 1.0 0.0

# Equal feedforward to both outputs (intentionally wrong)
CONNECTION S0 O1 60.0
CONNECTION S1 O1 60.0
CONNECTION S0 O0 60.0
CONNECTION S1 O0 60.0
