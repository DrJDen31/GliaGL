# Visualization

## Purpose

- Visualize network activity: OpenGL app to visualize network activity in real-time
- Use cloth physics sim to achieve simplified/visualizable/conveivable network structure: Connected neurons will pull on each other (similar to the cloth sim) in order to create a 3D structure that represents the network even with many neurons and recurrent loops that matches 3D visualizations of layered networks
