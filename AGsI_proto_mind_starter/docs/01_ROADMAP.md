# 01 — Roadmap & Milestones

**A. Stable Sparse Encoders**  
- Output: repeatable SDRs (1–5% active) for images/audio.  
- Proofs: class-overlap matrices; augmentation robustness.

**B. Association/Attractor Layer**  
- k‑WTA (≈2–5% active), mild recurrence, weight norm + heterosynaptic LTD.  
- Proofs: cue completion; persistence after input removal (100–300 ms).

**C. Cross‑Modal Binding (Paired)**  
- Plastic Enc↔Assoc with three‑factor rule; tiny η; short gates.  
- Proofs: cross‑cue (image→word, word→image); assembly identity stability.

**D. Index (fast) vs Cortex (slow)**  
- Index learns quickly; Cortex almost frozen; micro‑replay consolidates.  
- Proofs: few‑shot formation; long‑horizon stability; low weight drift.

**E. Predict→Imagine→Reconstruct**  
- Assoc→Enc feedback; mask‑and‑reconstruct drills.  
- Proofs: next‑frame prediction error ↓; hetero‑association demos.

**F. Global Workspace (GW)**  
- Competitive hub; ignition threshold uses novelty/consistency.  
- Proofs: non‑linear ignition curves; “reportability” gating to heads.

**G. Safety & Interpretability**  
- Assembly atlas, probes, lesion/stim tests, drift meters, token bucket.  
- Proofs: controlled learning episodes; explainable pathways to outputs.
