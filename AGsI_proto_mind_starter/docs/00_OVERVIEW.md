# 00 — Overview & Intent

**Goal:** Build a *mind‑like* spiking system that learns **online** by forming **sparse assemblies** that bind multiple modalities (vision/audio/labels), with a small **fast‑plastic Index** (hippocampal vibe), a larger **slow Cortex** (concept store), **predictive loops**, and a **Global Workspace** (GW) to broadcast salient assemblies to language/visual/motor heads.

**Key properties**
- Multimodal associative memory via **three‑factor plasticity** (eligibility × neuromodulation × gate).
- **k‑WTA** competition to keep assemblies small and reduce interference.
- **Index↔Cortex (CLS)**: rapid binding + slow consolidation with replay.
- **Predictive coding** feedback: top‑down predictions vs residuals.
- **Global Workspace** ignition for “reportable” thought (language/visualization/motor).
- **Safety & interpretability** baked in: drift meters, token‑bucket plasticity, assembly atlases, gates logging.
