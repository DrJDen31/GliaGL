# 04 — Global Workspace (GW)

**Purpose:** Turn rich but local assemblies into *reportable* thoughts by harsh competition + broadcast.

**Ignition criteria**
- Assembly stability over T ms
- High confidence / low prediction error
- Novelty within a band
- (Optional) task attention flag

**Outputs**
- Broadcast to language/visual/motor heads
- Log a GW event ({assembly_id, inputs, novelty, consistency, heads_triggered}).

**Proofs**
- Non‑linear ignition curve vs stimulus strength
- Lesion the GW → reportability drops while subconscious processing continues
