# 05 — Interpretability & Safety

**Assembly Atlas**
- Cluster co‑activation to map assemblies per layer; track drift & overlap.

**Probes & RSA**
- Train lightweight linear probes on frozen logs to decode labels/contexts.
- Representational Similarity across modalities/time.

**Causal Tools**
- Lesion: silence a subset; verify expected behavioral loss.
- Stimulate: micro‑activate an assembly; expect hetero‑association (imagination).

**Safety Rails**
- Token bucket on plasticity gates
- Per‑neuron weight norm + metaplastic anchors
- OOD guard: if novelty high & consistency low → block GW/motor

**Transparency**
- Every update carries a reason code and magnitudes logged per time window.
