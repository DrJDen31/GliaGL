# 06 — Metrics & Expected Proofs

- **Encoder stability:** class overlap matrices; augmentation curves.
- **Attractor tests:** cue completion rate; persistence half‑life.
- **Cross‑modal:** image→word & word→image accuracy; assembly Jaccard across modalities.
- **Few‑shot:** exposures until assembly formed; later recall success.
- **Prediction:** next‑frame error vs exposure count; residual energy.
- **GW:** ignition probability vs strength/attention; report latency.
- **Safety:** drift ‖W − W_base‖; token‑bucket usage; reasons histogram.
