# XOR Baseline (Structured, Trainable)
# Purpose: Same topology as the crafted XOR net (includes AND/coincidence neuron),
# but with neutral, moderate weights to allow training to shape behavior.
# This should be learnable to XOR via the trainerâ€™s weight updates.

# Format
# NEURON <id> <threshold> <leak> <resting>
# CONNECTION <from_id> <to_id> <weight>

# Sensory
NEURON S0 100.0 1.0 0.0
NEURON S1 100.0 1.0 0.0

# Hidden AND/coincidence neuron (N0) and outputs
NEURON N0 90.0 0.0 0.0   # AND detector (leak=0)
NEURON O1 50.0 1.0 0.0   # XOR true
NEURON O0 60.0 1.0 0.0   # XOR false

# Neutral feedforward: inputs excite O1 and N0 moderately (trainable)
CONNECTION S0 O1 40.0
CONNECTION S1 O1 40.0
CONNECTION S0 N0 60.0
CONNECTION S1 N0 60.0

# N0 projects moderately but not enough to fully flip 11 (pretrain ~3/4)
CONNECTION N0 O1 -40.0
CONNECTION N0 O0  40.0
