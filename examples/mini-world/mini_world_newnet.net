# NEWNET configuration for Mini-World (32x32, ON/OFF => 2048 sensory)
# - 2048 sensory (S), 2048 hidden (H), 5 outputs (O0..O4)
# - Includes an inhibitory pool neuron (N0) for soft WTA among outputs
# - Densities are kept modest to keep training manageable

NEWNET S=2048 H=1536 O=5 POOL=1

# Connectivity densities (probabilities)
