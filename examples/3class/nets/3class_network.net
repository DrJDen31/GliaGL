# 3-Class One-Hot Classification with Noise + Inhibitory Pool
# Format: Lines starting with # are comments
# NEURON <id> <threshold> <leak> <resting>
# CONNECTION <from_id> <to_id> <weight>

# Network structure:
# S0, S1, S2 = sensory inputs (one-hot encoded classes)
# N0 = inhibitory pool neuron
# O0 = class 0 output
# O1 = class 1 output
# O2 = class 2 output

# All neurons are now defined in config (fully self-contained)

# Sensory neurons (will be stimulated externally)
NEURON S0 100.0 1.0 0.0
NEURON S1 100.0 1.0 0.0
NEURON S2 100.0 1.0 0.0

# Output neurons (define BEFORE pool so they process first)
NEURON O0 50.0 1.0 0.0  # Class 0 output
NEURON O1 50.0 1.0 0.0  # Class 1 output
NEURON O2 50.0 1.0 0.0  # Class 2 output

# Interneurons (process AFTER outputs for same-tick WTA)
NEURON N0 30.0 0.8 0.0  # Inhibitory pool: LOWER threshold for faster WTA

# Feedforward connections (sensory -> output)
CONNECTION S0 O0 60.0
CONNECTION S1 O1 60.0
CONNECTION S2 O2 60.0

# Output to pool connections
CONNECTION O0 N0 35.0
CONNECTION O1 N0 35.0
CONNECTION O2 N0 35.0

# Pool to output connections (inhibitory) - STRONGER for better suppression
CONNECTION N0 O0 -55.0
CONNECTION N0 O1 -55.0
CONNECTION N0 O2 -55.0
