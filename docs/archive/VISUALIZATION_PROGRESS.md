## Status: Phase 1 Complete ✅

Successfully implemented Phase 1: Core Data Structures

---

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. NeuronParticle Class ✅
**Files:** `src/vis/neuron_particle.h`, `src/vis/neuron_particle.cpp`

Complete implementation of neurons as 3D particles with:
- **Spatial properties**: position, velocity, acceleration, mass
- **Visual properties**: base_color, active_color, current_color, size
- **Activation tracking**: firing state, activation level (EMA)
- **Connection management**: outgoing connections with weights
- **Type system**: SENSORY, INTERNEURON, OUTPUT

**Color Scheme:**
- Sensory: Blue (0.2, 0.5, 1.0) → Bright Blue when active
- Interneuron: Gray (0.3, 0.3, 0.3) → Yellow-Orange (1.0, 0.8, 0.0) when active
- Output: Purple (0.8, 0.2, 0.8) → Bright Magenta when active

**Key Methods:**
```cpp
void updateActivationState();  // Query neuron firing, update activation level
void updateColor(float alpha); // Interpolate colors based on activation
void addConnection(NeuronParticle* target, double weight);
```

### 2. NetworkGraph Class ✅
**Files:** `src/vis/network_graph.h`, `src/vis/network_graph.cpp`

Complete implementation of network as spatial graph with:

**Initialization:**
- `buildFromGlia()` - Converts Glia neural network → NetworkGraph
- `initializeSpatialLayout()` - Places neurons in S-IIIII-O layout
- `computeLayerDepths()` - BFS from sensory neurons for layered layout

**Physics Simulation (Training Mode):**
- `animatePhysics()` - Spring-based position updates with Euler integration
- `computeSpringForce()` - F = k * (L0 - L) * direction
- `applyProvotCorrection()` - Prevents over-stretching of connections

**Activation Visualization (Inference Mode):**
- `updateActivationStates()` - Query all neuron firing states
- `updateColors()` - Update all particle colors based on activation

**Spatial Layout:**
- Sensory neurons: Fixed on left plane (x = -5.0)
- Output neurons: Fixed on right plane (x = +5.0)
- Interneurons: Layered by connectivity depth, free to move

**Parameters:**
```cpp
x_left = -5.0f;         // Left boundary
x_right = 5.0f;         // Right boundary
y_span = 4.0f;          // Vertical spread
z_span = 4.0f;          // Depth spread
rest_length = 1.0f;     // Target spacing
k_connection = 10.0;    // Base spring constant
damping = 0.5;          // Velocity damping
```

### 3. Build System Integration ✅
**Files:** `src/vis/CMakeLists.txt`, `src/vis/Makefile.test`

- Updated CMakeLists.txt to include:
  - `neuron_particle.cpp`
  - `network_graph.cpp`
  - `../arch/glia.cpp`
  - `../arch/neuron.cpp`
- Added include path for `../arch` directory
- Created standalone test Makefile for verification

### 4. Test Program ✅
**File:** `src/vis/test_network_graph.cpp`

Simple test program that:
1. Creates XOR network (2 sensory, 3 interneurons)
2. Loads configuration from `xor_network.net`
3. Builds NetworkGraph from Glia
4. Tests mode switching (Training ↔ Inference)
5. Runs physics simulation (5 steps)
6. Tests activation visualization (10 network ticks)

## Implementation Details

### Output Neuron Detection
As recommended, output neurons are detected by:
- **Heuristic**: Neurons with no outgoing connections
- Changes their type from INTERNEURON → OUTPUT
- Makes them anchored (fixed = true) on right plane

### Layered Layout Algorithm
Uses BFS from sensory neurons to compute connectivity depth:
```
Depth 0: Sensory neurons (S0, S1)
Depth 1: Neurons directly connected from sensory
Depth 2: Neurons connected from depth 1
...
```

X position: `x = x_left + (x_range / max_depth) * depth`

This creates natural layers that reflect information flow through the network.

### Spring Force Calculation
```cpp
Vec3f computeSpringForce(NeuronParticle* p1, NeuronParticle* p2, double weight) {
    // Normalize spring constant by max expected weight (120.0)
    double k = k_connection * abs(weight) / 120.0;
    
    // Standard spring force: F = k * (L0 - L) * direction
    Vec3f diff = p1->position - p2->position;
    double length = diff.Length();
    Vec3f direction = diff / length;
    
    return direction * k * (rest_length - length);
}
```

**Key insight**: Sign of weight (excitatory/inhibitory) doesn't affect spatial attraction, only magnitude matters.

### Activation Smoothing
Uses Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for smooth color transitions:
```cpp
if (is_firing) {
    activation_level = 1.0f;  // Instant jump on fire
} else {
    activation_level *= (1.0f - decay_alpha);  // Smooth decay
}
```

Decay rate: α = 0.15 (fast enough to see spikes, slow enough for smooth transitions)

## Testing Plan

### Integration Tests (Next Phase)

- [ ] Connection rendering as lines
- [ ] Camera controls work correctly
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts (T, I, Space, etc.)

## Next Steps: Phase 2 - Spring Physics Polish

### Immediate Tasks

1. **Test Standalone Program**
   ```bash
   cd src/vis
   make -f Makefile.test
   ./test_network_graph
   ```
   Verify all functionality works without OpenGL.

2. **Fix Any Compilation Issues**
   - Resolve include path problems
   - Fix missing dependencies
   - Handle platform-specific differences

3. **Tune Physics Parameters**
   - Adjust spring constant for realistic motion
   - Test convergence speed (does network stabilize?)
   - Verify no "explosions" or instability
   - Tune damping to prevent oscillation

4. **Improve Output Detection**
   Currently uses heuristic (no outgoing connections).
   Consider adding to `.net` file format:
   ```
   OUTPUT N1 N2
   ```

### Phase 2 Tasks (Rendering)

1. **Update MeshData Structure**
   Add fields for network visualization:
   ```cpp
   // Network visualization data
   int neuronCount;
   int connectionCount;
   float* neuronData;      // positions + colors + sizes
   float* connectionData;  // line segments + colors
   bool show_neurons;
   bool show_connections;
   bool show_labels;
   ```

2. **Implement PackMesh() Functions**
   ```cpp
   void NetworkGraph::packNeurons(float* &current);
   void NetworkGraph::packConnections(float* &current);
   ```

3. **Update OpenGLRenderer**
   - Add VBOs for neurons and connections
   - Render neurons as spheres (or point sprites)
   - Render connections as lines
   - Support different rendering modes

4. **Add Keyboard Controls**
   - T: Toggle training mode
   - I: Toggle inference mode
   - Space: Pause/resume
   - N: Single network tick
   - P: Toggle physics
   - C: Toggle connections
   - L: Toggle labels

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **No Rendering Yet**
   - packMesh(), packNeurons(), packConnections() are placeholders
   - Need full OpenGL integration

2. **Simple Output Detection**
   - Heuristic may fail for some network topologies
   - Should add explicit OUTPUT directive to .net format

3. **Fixed Parameters**
   - Spring constants, damping, etc. are hardcoded
   - Should be tunable via command line or config file

4. **No Visualization of Spike Propagation**
   - Connection activation tracking exists but not rendered
   - Should show "traveling dot" along connections

5. **No Labels**
   - Can't see neuron IDs in visualization
   - Should add text rendering for hover/selection

### Performance Considerations

Current implementation should handle:
- **Small networks** (< 100 neurons): No issues
- **Medium networks** (100-1000 neurons): May need optimization
- **Large networks** (> 1000 neurons): Will need spatial partitioning

For large networks:
- Use octree for neighbor queries
- Implement LOD (level of detail)
- Move physics to GPU (compute shaders)
